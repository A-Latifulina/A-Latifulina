### Hi, I'm Addy ðŸŒ±

<p> I used to only create with pencils and paint. <br>
Eventually, I grew tired of carrying around a very heavy portfolio. <br>
I thought, how nice it'd be to have my work & never shlep it. <br>
So, I turned to digital media. <br>
I played with photos, videos, vectors, 3D modeling & manufacturing, & VR. <br>
Gradually, software became the medium & the message. <br>
<br>
In recent years, I've been diving into protocols, standards, security, & scripting. <br></p>
