### Hi, I'm Addy 

<p> I used to create with pencils and paint. <br>
Eventually, I grew tired of carrying around a very heavy portfolio. <br>
I thought, how nice it'd be to have my work & never shlep it. <br>
So, I turned to digital media. <br>
Gradually, software became the medium & the message. <br>
<br>
Nowadays, I like to study software, specifically protocols, standards, & security. <br></p>
